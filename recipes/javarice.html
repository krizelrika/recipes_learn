    <h1>Filipino Style Java Rice</h1>
    <h3>Aromatic and flavorful, this Filipino Style Java Rice is our favorite match with fried or grilled meat and seafood, as well as steamed dishes!</h3>

<h4>Equipment</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 large wok</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
        <li>4 cups cooked long grain white rice <em>I recommend basmati white rice</em></li>
        <li>2 tbsp. cooking oil <em>neutral oil recommended</em></li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp annatto powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a wok or a large skillet. Add the minced garlic, turmeric and annatto powder. Toss and mix until the garlic is aromatic and softened.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked rice and stir to distribute the spices and the color is uniform. Add they soy sauce.</li>
    <li>Continue to cook, tossing everything occasionally until the rice is heated through and slightly crisp. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Turn off heat. Serve immediately.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Basmati white is my favorite rice to make Java. It is fluffy, light and does not clump together. It just makes a beautiful fried rice and I love it! With that said, feel free to use jasmine rice, this recipe works either way!</li>
   <li>This is a base recipe. You could elevate it with some chopped onions, bell peppers and green onions.</li>
</ul>
